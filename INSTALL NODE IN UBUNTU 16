INSTALL NODE IN UBUNTU 16  


For the currently active release (the 7.x branch), use:

#	curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_7.x | sudo -E bash -

The PPA will be added to your configuration and your local package cache will be updated automatically. After running the setup script from nodesource, you can install the Node.js package in the same way that you did above:

#	sudo apt-get install nodejs

The nodejs package contains the nodejs binary as well as npm, so you don't need to install npm separately. However, in order for some npm packages to work (such as those that require building from source), you will need to install the build-essentials package:

#	sudo apt-get install build-essential
